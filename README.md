# TattleTale
A curationist approach to create compelling emergent narratives.

## What does it do?
TattleTale tries to create compelling narrative snippets, detailing the lifes of highschoolers.

## How does it work?
To create the narrative snippets TattleTale uses two core concepts:
- **Overgenerate**: First the application simulates the lives of students over a number of days. This creates a large volume of interconnected events, emotions and relationships. This whole process is also highly configurable, including a way to add custom events after compilation. 
- **Curate**: Using the large volume created in the previous step, the application tries to find the best possible chain of events. For this it uses four different approaches, as it is not exactly clear yet what curation approach works best. 

For a more detailed explanation on how this process works check out my master thesis on curation [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XbeYaGO_O8KFQ7I4v9t6_RX7E4qNBDkl/view).

You can also look over the autogenerated documentation [here](https://amonshokhinahmed.github.io/TattleTale/html/index.html).

## How to build:

Compile using CMake:
- `cmake -S . -B ./build`
- `cmake --build ./build`

This will have built three binaries:
- a library containing the simulation and curation
- an executable using the library to run a number of simulations
- an executable performing unit tests on the library

Next to the exexutables you will find a resource folder where you can change some basic things for the simulation, like the possible names for the students or which interactions they can perform.

Automated actions have been able to compile TattleTale for Windows, Mac and Linux but extensive testing was only done on Windows, so no guarantees can be made for the other two platforms.

## An example of the narrative output:

> Setting:
> 
> The seed was 1.
> Simulated 15 days with 300 actors that had 
> between 0 and 4 established relationship at the 
> start.
> They had 6 courses per day with 30 actors per 
> course and each course was run 4 times per week.
> During freetime the actors could choose to 
> interact from a group of 6 other actors.
> For the curation kernel chains of maximum size 
> 5 were considered.
> 
> .....................................................................
> 
> Rarity Curation:
> 
> On a regular day Garrett Butter would be greeting others but this time some highly interesting things happened around them. Before telling the story let's take a look at our main character. Garrett wanted to be fully accepted by their peers. Before this all started they were feeling completely brave.
> 
> The story begins when Garrett broke up with So Greenwood, because Garrett felt completely brave which in turn increased So's anger for Garrett.
> During the same week they were also feeling very unfulfilled. Because of this So called Garrett names.
> 
> .....................................................................

> Absolute Interest Curation:
> 
> On a regular day Margery Poulton would be looking at someone cute but this time some highly interesting things happened around them. Before telling the story let's take a look at our main character. Margery wanted to have a loving relationship. Before this all started they were feeling completely unfulfilled.
> 
> The story begins when Tegan Linley sold some drugs to Margery, because Tegan wanted to be fully accepted by their peers which in turn made Margery more satisfied.

> Shortly after they were also wanting to have a loving relationship and they were also feeling  love for Beula Anthony. Because of this Margery and Beula made love.

Before telling the story let's > take a look at our main character. Josiah wanted to be the most powerful person in school. Before this all started they were feeling completely happy and quite unfulfilled.

> At the same time they were also feeling  friendship for Josiah. Because of this Genevive commiserated with Josiah which in turn made Josiah less happy.

> 
> On a regular day Elsy Garber would be looking at someone cute but this time some slightly interesting things happened around them. Before telling the story let's take a look at our main character. Elsy wanted to have a loving relationship. Before this all started they were feeling completely happy and brave.
